I am not sure what this project is going to be about
My goal is to focus on the git pushes and to use the terminal to set up all of the files

Update later in the day
I have finished the project! the coolest part was after I got a page done, I was able to copy that file in the terminal and then open it up and change all the data. It was really cool to work through the terminal to add changes through git and to also open up all my files in the terminal. It is really starting to feel like I am a real programmer.
